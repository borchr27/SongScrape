# SongScrape
A work in progress to scrape chords from a popular music site (chordify) then assemble and create a chords assistant on the console. 
Make sure you have the latest version of google chrome, chromedriver, and the .yml environment file located on my anaconda cloud site
found here (https://anaconda.org/borchr27/songscrape2). I would use anaconda to run the environment, but if youre thrifty enough to
do it another way, mo power to ya. Next steps include adding pause functionality, listening to song while displaying chords, changing tempo
funtionality, and using Phantom.js so user doesnt have to watch chrome open and close.

# SongScrape
A project I built to scrape chords from a popular music site (chordify) then assemble and create a chords assistant on the console. 
Make sure you have the latest version of google chrome, chromedriver, and the .yml environment file (https://anaconda.org/borchr27/songscrape2) or the requirements.txt located in the repo. Next steps include adding pause functionality, utilize threading (done),listening to the song while displaying chords (done), auto changing tempo funtionality (done), using Phantom.js so user doesnt have to watch chrome open and close, and being able to try getting chords from the ultimate guitar website. Need to create venv for this project.
